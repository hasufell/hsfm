-- |This module provides high-level IO related file operations like
-- copy, delete, move and so on. It only operates on `Path Abs` which
-- guarantees us well-typed paths which are absolute.
--
-- Some functions are just path-safe wrappers around
-- unix functions, others have stricter exception handling
-- and some implement functionality that doesn't have a unix
-- counterpart (like `copyDirRecursive`).
--
-- Some of these operations are due to their nature not _atomic_, which
-- means they may do multiple syscalls which form one context. Some
-- of them also have to examine the filetypes explicitly before the
-- syscalls, so a reasonable decision can be made. That means
-- the result is undefined if another process changes that context
-- while the non-atomic operation is still happening. However, where
-- possible, as few syscalls as possible are used and the underlying
-- exception handling is kept.
